The particulars :

The local pet shop 'CuddlyCritters' needs your help!
CuddlyCritters has just unveil their new webpage unfortunately customers are running in the other direction.
Insted of hiring a professional web designer to design the shops new website the store owner figured he could save a few dollars by asking his son to make it instead. The company is loosing costumers and money and now the poor little animals are having an even harder time finding homes! lets just say the site isnt so Cuddly.

can you fix the webpage? 
If so the owner would like to request a few things:

Replace the not so cuddly photos!
have a friendly greeting greet the costumer when they arrive at the site
fix the bland color scheme
find a more interesting photo layout
he would also like if the names of the animal shows up when the user clicks/hover the photo (' hi my name is ___ ')
